		<h2 style="text-align: center;">Throw Away Your Two Bucket Wash Method</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
				&emsp; The two bucket wash method is used in car detailing. As the name suggests, the two bucket
				method
				includes having two buckets. Each bucket has a grit guard. The grit guard is a plastic divider that
				goes at the bottom of the bucket. It is there to separate dirty water from clean water. One bucket
				is called the rinse and the other is the wash. The rinse bucket has water. The wash bucket has both
				water and car soap. When using the two bucket wash method, first rinse the car down with water. You
				can use either a garden hose or a pressure washer. Then put a wash mitt in the wash bucket and apply
				the soapy solution to the car. Work in a small section. After a small section, put the mitt in the
				rinse bucket and lightly agitate the mitt against the grit guard. Next, put the mitt in the wash
				bucket and repeat. When the entire car is washed, rinse the car to remove any soapy residue.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p> &emsp;The purpose of the two bucket method is to separate the dirty water from the clean water. With one
				bucket, you end up rubbing contaminants back onto the car’s surface. Doing so increases your chances
				of scratching the clear coat. Therefore, professional detailers avoid the one bucket method. The one
				bucket method is just the wash bucket from the two bucket method. There is no rinse bucket. Without
				the rinse bucket, the wash bucket gets dirty quickly. Thus, it renders the soap useless. However, to
				use the one bucket method effectively, a rinseless wash is used instead of soap. A rinseless wash
				does not create foam. Instead, it looks like water with a slight color change. But make no mistake,
				the added polymers give lubrication. The lubrication eliminates the pre and post-rinse. With
				rinseless wash, you submerge the wash mitt in the solution and wipe gently on the car’s surface. The
				solution encapsulates the dirt in the wash mitt. After a small section is done, put the wash mitt
				back into the bucket. There is no need to agitate the mitt against the girt guard because the
				solution releases the dirt towards the bottom. The purpose of the grit guard, in this case, is to
				prevent the mitt from touching the contaminated bottom of the solution. After you wash the car, you
				buff it dry with a microfiber towel.</p>
			<br>
			<p> &emsp; Despite having one fewer bucket, the one bucket method is superior. The first reason is using
				less
				water. Generally speaking, a standard bucket is five gallons. That is five fewer gallons of water.
				Also, water is not wasted during both the pre and post-rinse. This is important in places with water
				restrictions. Another advantage is for people living in an apartment. These people don’t have access
				to a garden hose. One bucket method requires no rinsing. You can use the one bucket method, with
				rinseless wash, in the car’s interior. These include the inside glass, and plastics such as
				dashboards, steering wheels, and door jambs. Try to bring car soap into the interior and you will
				probably damage the electronics. Furthermore, the one bucket method is more time-efficient. Not
				having to use the rinse bucket allows you to work around the car faster. Despite having many
				advantages, the one bucket method is not as common as the two bucket method. One reason is people
				are not aware. But the main issue is the car detailing product manufacturers. They will rather sell
				you two buckets than one. I learned that profit beats being environmentally friendly.</p>
